# Introduction

MixedModels.jl is part of the JuliaStats ecosystem and so shares a number of interface and design elements with GLM.jl.
MixedModels.jl can also be viewed as the next step in the research programme behind the R package lme4 (and further back, nlme).
The focus of development is on linear mixed effects models with unconstrained covariance matrices, with a secondary focus on generalized linear mixed effects models.
We'll come back to this focus later, when we discuss limitations of the software. For now, let us start off with a simple mixed model.

```{julia}
using MixedModels
MixedModels.datasets()
```
