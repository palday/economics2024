title: "Mixed Effects Models in Julia"
---

This website contains the course materials for an introduction to mixed effects models in Julia using [MixedModels.jl](https://juliastats.org/MixedModels.jl/v4/).

## Prerequisites

The material here assumes a basic proficiency with the Julia language, including a working Julia installation with Julia 1.9+.

## Installation of Course Materials

This repository uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org) with the Julia code execution supplied by [QuartoNotebookRunner.jl](https://github.com/PumasAI/QuartoNotebookRunner.jl/), which requires Quarto 1.5+.

As of early May 2024, Quarto 1.5 is only available as a preview release, which you'll need to [download from GitHub](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/releases). Under each release's "Assets", you can find platform-specific installers.
